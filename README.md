# SquireForHire
A simple text-based adventure game about a squire shopping for goods at a market.

This is a project that I submitted for an assignment at AIE. It is the barebones of a larger project I am working on independantly.

Game navigation is completly text based:

to move type: move + any of the cardinal directions as a single letter (n/s/e/w)
when at a vendor stall simply type: talk (to see more about them) OR browse (view there wears)
to view your inventory simple type: i
to use an item type: use + the name of the item (some items can be used but have no tangiable effect in this version of the game)

currently you cannot view your shopping list, but to check if an item is on your shopping list type: search + name of item
this will tell you if the item is on your shopping list and IF the has been obtained

There is currently NO END in this version of the game and is just the exploration/ shopping parts of the game.
